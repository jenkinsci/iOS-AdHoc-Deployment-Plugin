##Over-the-Air Ad Hoc Deployment Plugin For iOS

The OTA Builder & Uploader Plugin automates the process of building the OTA package for your XCode Project, Uploading it and Mailing the client. The plugin is built on JRuby.

###What it does?
The working of this plugin can be summarized like this.

*   Get from you some details about your apps, like path to location of ipa file, icon file location, bundle identifier and version, ftp and gmail credentials as well as reciever mail ids
*   It executes after the .ipa file get built, so this plugin works in  with [XCode Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Xcode+Plugin)
*   Once the XCode plugin finishes it's work successfully, the plugin get the .ipa file, and build the Manifest.plist for your app, so OTA Transmission is possible.
*   Uploads the .ipa,icon file and manifest file to your ftp server, and with the help of http translation data generate the itms link for your app.
*   Email the given list of people the link, so they can install the app on their device in a click.
*   Optionally you can customize the mail that is to be sent, or leave it blank, the default mail will be sent.
